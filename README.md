My name is Juan Pablo Meza and I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science student.

In this GitHub repository I am displaying some of the projects I had to do while working on my Certification with Python.

Some of the libraries that are used in this repository are: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tkinter.

This repository also demonstrates the use of Jupyter Notebooks.
